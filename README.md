# Concertmaster: An experiment in gesteral architectural lighting control 
Controlling the Pausch Bridge lights using a Leap Motion

This repository contains a copy of OpenFrameworks (0.9.0) with all of the necessary addons and the application for using the Leap. Before running the application, you will need to adjust the IP address (commented) to point to the PBridge server. You will also need to have your Leap Motion Controller plugged in. (You may need to have the Leap Motion application installed as well.) Finally, this repository includes a simple UDP listener written in python to run on the PBridge server.

Complete documentation for this project is available at [https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/master/students/ryan/project4.md](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/master/students/ryan/project4.md)

Special thanks to Evan Shimizu for his advice, and for creating the Lumiverse lighting control framework, which was sponsored by the The Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry at Carnegie Mellon University
